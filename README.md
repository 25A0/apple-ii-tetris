A simple Tetris clone for Apple II, inspired by Daniel Shiffman's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7r83N3c2kPw) on coding Snake on an Apple II.

## How to play

1. Copy the entire content of the file "tetris.applesoft" to your clipboard
1. Open the Apple II emulator at https://www.scullinsteel.com/apple2/
1. Press F1 or click "Reset" on the on-screen keyboard
1. Paste the content of your clipboard and wait for the pasting to complete
1. Type "RUN" and press return to start the game

After the "Game Over" screen, press any key to quit.
You should then see a blinking `]` prompt again.
From there you can type "RUN" again, and press return, to start the game again.

There are probably better ways to load the program into an emulator,
but I didn't have time to learn how to use disks, so here we are (:
